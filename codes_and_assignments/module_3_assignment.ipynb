    "# Graded Lab : Tool Use and Reflective Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will explore how AI agents can enhance research workflows by leveraging external tools and engaging in critical self-reflection. You'll learn how to build and integrate callable tools—such as web and academic search functions, and connect them to a language model using OpenAI's tool-calling API. Then, you’ll guide the agent to not only generate content but also **reflect** on its own output, improving the quality and depth of the final report. By the end of this lab, you will have implemented a mini agent capable of searching, reasoning, and publishing structured reports in HTML—laying the foundation for more advanced multi-step and autonomous AI systems."

Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a hybrid AI framework that bolsters large language models (LLMs) by combining them with external, up-to-date data sources. Instead of relying solely on static training data, RAG retrieves relevant documents at query time and feeds them into the model as context. This process flow helps developers update data sources without retraining the model and makes RAG a scalable and cost-effective solution for building LLM applications in domains like customer support, knowledge bases and internal search. This is called retrieval augmented generation (RAG), as you would retrieve the relevant data and use it as augmented context for the LLM. With RAG architecture, organizations can deploy any LLM model and augment it to return relevant results for their organization by giving it a small amount of their data without the costs and time of fine-tuning or pretraining the model.', 'url': 'https://www.databricks.com/glossary/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag'}\n",

The court clerk of AI is a process called retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG for short. Retrieval-augmented generation is a technique for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models with information fetched from specific and relevant data sources. The paper, with coauthors from the former Facebook AI Research (now Meta AI), University College London and New York University, called RAG “a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe” because it can be used by nearly any LLM to connect with practically any external resource. Retrieval-augmented generation gives models sources they can cite, like footnotes in a research paper, so users can check any claims. The NVIDIA AI Blueprint for RAG gives developers a foundational starting point for using NVIDIA NeMo Retriever models to build scalable, customizable data extraction and retrieval pipelines that deliver high accuracy and throughput.', 'url': 'https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/'}\n",

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model, so it references an authoritative knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response. It redirects the LLM to retrieve relevant information from authoritative, pre-determined knowledge sources. Developers can also restrict sensitive information retrieval to different authorization levels and ensure the LLM generates appropriate responses. Without RAG, the LLM takes the user input and creates a response based on information it was trained on—or what it already knows. With RAG, an information retrieval component is introduced that utilizes the user input to first pull information from a new data source. Next, the RAG model augments the user input (or prompts) by adding the relevant retrieved data in context. Semantic search enhances RAG results for organizations wanting to add vast external knowledge sources to their LLM applications.', 'url': 'https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/'}\n"

      "### Overview of Radio Observations of Recurrent Novae\n",
      "\n",
      "Recurrent novae (RNe) are unique in that they undergo multiple outbursts over time, as opposed to classical novae, which are typically singular events. Radio observations of recurrent novae provide critical insights into the mechanisms and physical conditions prevalent during these explosive events. Below are some key findings and observations from recent studies on this topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Case Studies and Observations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **The 2011 Outburst of Recurrent Nova T Pyxidis (T Pyx)**\n",
      "   - T Pyx is a peculiar recurrent nova known for its unusual outburst characteristics. Radio observations conducted during its 2011 outburst using instruments like the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array revealed unexpected behaviors. Notably, the radio flux began rising later than anticipated, indicating that the radio-emitting ejecta were either very cold or expanding slowly for approximately the first 50 days post-outburst. The observed high peak radio flux densities suggested a massive ejection of material, which is atypical for recurrent novae, hinting at a potentially under-massive white dwarf [Source: ApJ Article](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...785...78N).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Low-frequency Radio Observations of RS Ophiuchi (RS Oph)**\n",
      "   - The radio light curves of another recurrent nova, RS Oph, typically exhibit an initial rise where the ejecta become partially optically thick. Such observations help in understanding the velocity and composition of the outflowing material and its interaction with the surrounding environmental medium [Source: MNRAS Article](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/523/1/132/7159730).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **General Properties and Challenges**\n",
      "   - Recurrent novae like RS Oph and T Pyx exhibit radio emissions during their outbursts. These emissions arise due to synchrotron radiation from accelerating particles within the shock fronts created as nova ejecta interact with the surrounding circumstellar material. The radio observations offer clues about the mass loss, interaction dynamics, and energy distribution in such systems [Source: ASPC Conference Paper](https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1996ASPC...93..165B).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Comprehensive Reviews and Theoretical Insights\n",
      "\n",
      "- A comprehensive review of recurrent novae, including their radio observations, has highlighted the growing interest in examining these eruptions across multiple wavelengths, including radio, optical, and X-rays. This multi-wavelength approach provides a holistic view of the processes involved and helps resolve longstanding enigmas, such as the unusual behaviors exhibited by RNe like T Pyx [Source: arXiv Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4526).\n",
      "\n",
      "- A broader understanding of RN radio observations is encapsulated in studies that highlight both the similarities and differences between classical and recurrent novae in terms of brightness levels, frequency of eruptions, and radio emission characteristics [Source: University of Manchester Report](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/files/54518617/FULL_TEXT.PDF).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusions\n",
      "\n",
      "Radio observations are indispensable for understanding the complex physical processes governing recurrent novae eruptions. Through these studies, astronomers can infer important properties such as the mass of ejected material and the dynamics of their interactions with the circumstellar medium. Continued multi-wavelength observations remain crucial for deepening our understanding of these fascinating astrophysical phenomena.\n",

    "In this task, your goal is to develop a function that takes a report, analyzes it, generates a structured reflection, and produces an improved version of the report.

    "- **Format**: Ensure the output includes two keys, `\"reflection\"` and `\"revised_report\"`.\n",
    "- **Details**: Your reflection should cover strengths, limitations, suggestions, and opportunities. The revised report should incorporate these elements to improve clarity and academic tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Configure the Response Call\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters**: Use the specified model (e.g., `\"gpt-4o-mini\"`) and set the temperature equal to the `temperature` parameter of the graded function.\n",
    "- **Structure**: Make sure the response setup directs the model properly, ensuring the JSON format is adhered to without additional commentary.\n",

    "\n",
    "By implementing these steps, your function will effectively transform and improve the given reports. Handle JSON parsing carefully to ensure the output is valid and reliable. Happy coding!"
