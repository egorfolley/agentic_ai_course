    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Lab Overview  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will step into the role of a **technical AI lead at a fashion brand** preparing a summer sunglasses campaign. Your task is to design a **fully automated creative pipeline** that mirrors a real-world business scenario. Instead of handling each piece manually, you will guide a system that scans online sources for emerging fashion trends, matches those trends with sunglasses in the internal catalog, designs a campaign visual, generates a short marketing quote, and finally packages everything into an **executive-ready report**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to experience how multiple agents, tools, and models can be orchestrated into a single, coherent workflow. By the end of this lab, you will have built a pipeline that feels less like a script of isolated steps and more like a small team working together to solve a creative challenge.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. 🎯 Learning outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this lab, you will see how to move beyond single-turn interactions with a model and instead design **multi-agent pipelines** that coordinate planning, research, and creative generation. You will learn how to ground agent reasoning in external tools so that outputs are not just imaginative but also supported by real data. You will also experiment with reflection and packaging steps that enforce quality control and prepare results for an executive audience.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, this lab is about learning how to combine the **imagination of large language models** with the **discipline of structured workflows**, giving you a practical pattern for building autonomous systems that are both creative and reliable.  "

       "\n",
       "1. Top Trends  \n",
       "   • Oversized “maxi” eyewear: Think bug-eye, statement frames that read as accessories in their own right.  \n",
       "   • Angular-square silhouettes: Sharp lines and chunky acetate lend attitude to any look.  \n",
       "   • Cool-metal wire frames: Ultra-light, sleek metal rims (often in silver or black) for a minimalist, tech-chic vibe.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Catalog Picks  \n",
       "   • Aviator (SG001)  \n",
       "     – Why it fits: Teardrop lenses in slim metal frames hit the “cool-metal wire” trend perfectly. The generous lens size also speaks to the oversized moment, while the classic pilot shape keeps it timeless.  \n",
       "   • Wayfarer (SG002)  \n",
       "     – Why it fits: Bold, angular acetate frames are the poster child for the “angular-square” silhouette. Their sturdy construction and confident proportions make them an ideal statement piece for summer street style.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Why These Work for Summer 2026  \n",
       "   – Both styles play off runway cues from brands like Balenciaga, Gucci and Prada, where big lenses and metal-thin rims dominated SS26 shows.  \n",
       "   – Aviator’s lightweight metal is perfect for all-day wear and pairs seamlessly with festival-ready or city-cool outfits.  \n",
       "   – Wayfarer’s chunkier profile taps into the resurgence of ’80s-’90s nostalgia with a modern edge—ideal for fashion-forward customers looking to elevate basic tees and dresses.\n",
       "\n",
       "Recommendation  \n",
       "Stock both SG001 and SG002 prominently in your summer campaign. Highlight Aviator’s metal-minimalism for the tech-chic set, and lead with Wayfarer for shoppers seeking bold, statement eyewear.</pre>\n",

       "\n",
       "1. Top Trends  \n",
       "   • Oversized “maxi-statement” frames (“bug-eye”) – Seen on runways at Balenciaga, Prada and Saint Laurent, these large-lens silhouettes double as standalone accessories.  \n",
       "   • Angular square “power-chic” shapes – Clean lines and bold acetate lend modern edge, a nod to the new minimalism.  \n",
       "   • Wire-frame/metal classics – Slim-rimmed metal sunglasses (think aviators) are having a major moment, offering a cool, sporty-meets-sleek vibe.  \n",
       "\n",
       "2. Catalog Recommendations  \n",
       "   • SG001 Aviator (thin metal frame, teardrop lenses)  \n",
       "     – Leans into the wire-frame/metal trend with built-in coverage and summer-friendly lightweight construction. The large teardrops also edge into the “maxi statement” territory.  \n",
       "   • SG002 Wayfarer (thick, angular acetate)  \n",
       "     – Hits the angular-square trend hard: bold profile, strong lines. A proven bestseller that reads both retro and directional.  \n",
       "   • SG005 Round (circular minimalist frame)  \n",
       "     – While not an oval per se, its soft, all-metal round lens covers the growing interest in sculptural round/soft-oval shapes and offers a fresh counterpoint to the sharper silhouettes.  \n",
       "\n",
       "3. Why They Work for Summer ’26  \n",
       "   – Each style taps a specific, editor-backed trend (oversize, angular, metal).  \n",
       "   – They span price points ($86–$103), broadening appeal.  \n",
       "   – Stocks are healthy (10–23 units), ensuring we can support a campaign push without immediate restock issues.  \n",
       "\n",
       "Together, these three deliver maximum trend coverage and give customers choice across three of the strongest 2026 summer shapes.</pre>\n",

    "\n",
    "By completing this lab, you have seen how to:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **multi-agent LLM pipelines** to automate a creative workflow end-to-end.  \n",
    "- Combine **reasoning, tool-calling, and external data** to ground your outputs in reality.  \n",
    "- Apply multimodal models (like `gpt-4o`) that process **both text and images** for tasks such as generating campaign quotes.  \n",
    "- Extend the model’s abilities with tools (`tavily_search_tool`, `product_catalog_tool`) so your outputs are not only imaginative but also practical.  \n",
    "- Keep execution **transparent and debuggable** with structured logging and HTML-styled blocks.  \n",
    "- Deliver a polished, **executive-ready report** in Markdown format that blends insights, visuals, and justifications into a single artifact.  \n",
